## For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:
***(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or***
***(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.***

1. Equitable Use
Our program provide the same core functionalities—buying, selling, searching, and browsing books—to all users without requiring specialized accounts or additional privileges. Also, features like universal search and book information access make the platform equally usable for everyone. To align fully to the idea, we can add screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation in the future that accommodates users with disabilities.

2. Flexibility in Use
Our program offers multiple ways to interact, such as searching by keywords, browsing by genre, or adding books to a shopping cart for later purchase. This will allow a wide range of user preferences and needs that align with flexibility in use. 

3. Simple and Intuitive Use
Our program interface is designed to be easy to navigate. For example, even users with minimal technical skills can navigate easily since features like labeled buttons ("Search," "Add to Wishlist") and error messages (e.g., "No results found") ensure users understand how to interact with the system.

4. Perceptible Information
To fully align to this principle, our program needs to ensure users of different sensory abilities or language skills can access the information they need. Since our program communicates in the text, we can add images and sound notifications for key actions in the future.


5. Tolerance for Error
In our program, Users can cancel orders before completion, minimizing the consequences of accidental purchases. To fully align to this principle, we can add features like "Undo" for actions such as removing books from the cart or deleting order in the future, where this will give users the opportunity to correct mistakes easily.

6. Low Physical Effort
Our program requires navigation and keyboard. If we want to fully align to this principle, we can add  voice-based search functionality in the future to reduce physical effort significantly.

7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
Although our program uses GUI where most platforms can simply view all features, we can have responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes and ensure usability across mobile phones, tablets, and desktops in the future. Furthermore, we can have choice provided for users to increase the size of interactive elements like buttons and dropdown menus 

## Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

If we were to market our program, we would primarily target students, parents, and avoid readers who are looking for more affordable options to purchase books. Specifically, our target customers are students. Particularly, a fair amount of students often seek second-hand textbooks to save money in higher education, and this will make our platform an ideal solution for their needs. Additionally, casual readers and book enthusiasts who enjoy exploring various genres or rare titles would find value in our comprehensive search features. In conclusion, we mainly target students in higher education and book enthusiasts and a wide range of individuals who value books as a resource worth reusing. 

## Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

Our program may be less likely to be used by certain demographics including older adults who struggle with navigating a digital platform, non-native speakers who are not fluent in the platform’s primary language, and individuals unfamiliar with online platforms. Specifically, older adults may find small text sizes or dense layouts that create barriers with declining vision or control. Also, non native speakers may struggle to use the platform effectively without support for multiple languages or simplified language options. Accordingly, this lack of inclusivity may harm many individuals. For example, tangible harm may be caused as older users might miss out on opportunities to buy affordable books or sell their unused ones. Furthermore, this may reinforce relational inequality by excluding them from the digital marketplace. To prevent these issues, we can align with the social model of disability by designing a platform that prevents impairments from becoming limitations. Specifically, we could adopt features like text-to-speech, voice-based search, and keyboard-friendly navigation. Implementing these changes would support democratic equality, ensuring the program is accessible to everyone, regardless of ability.
